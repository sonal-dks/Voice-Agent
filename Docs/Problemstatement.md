Voice Agent: Advisor Appointment Scheduler

Milestone brief
Create a voice agent that books a tentative advisor slot: collects topic + time preference, offers two slots, confirms, and then creates a calendar hold and notes entry + email draft via MCP. The caller gets a booking code and a secure link to finish details.

Who this helps
Users who want a human consult; PMs/Support running compliant pre-booking.

What you must build
Intents (5): book new, reschedule, cancel, “what to prepare,” check availability windows.
Flow: greet → disclaimer (“informational, not investment advice”) → confirm topic (KYC/Onboarding, SIP/Mandates, Statements/Tax Docs, Withdrawals & Timelines, Account Changes/Nominee) → collect day/time preference → offer two slots (mock calendar) → on confirm:
Generate Booking Code (e.g., NL-A742).
MCP Calendar: create tentative hold “Advisor Q&A — {Topic} — {Code}”.
MCP Notes/Doc: append {date, topic, slot, code} to “Advisor Pre-Bookings”.
MCP Email Draft: prepare advisor email with details (approval-gated).
Read the booking code + give a secure URL for contact details (outside the call).

Key constraints
No PII on the call (no phone/email/account numbers).
State time zone (IST) and repeat date/time on confirm.
If no slots match → create waitlist hold + draft email.
Refuse investment advice; provide educational links if asked.
